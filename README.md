Ckmeans.1d.dp is a dynamic programming algorithm for globally-optimal clustering
of one-dimensional vectors. Its reference implementation is in C++, wrapped in
an [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Ckmeans.1d.dp). This
module is a Cython wrapper around the C++ code inside that package.
