Version 3.4.6-4
  Changes
  2016-10-21
  1. Added an equal bin width histogram example to contrast with ahist()
  function.

  2016-10-16
  1. Moved ahist() function from visualize.R to a new R file ahist.R.

  2016-10-15
  1. Added a breaks argument to ahist() so as use default graphics::hist() but
     with the capacity to add sticks to the histogram generated.
  2. Added a skip.empty.bin.color argument to ahist() to gain more control over
     colors of the histogram bars.

  2016-10-12
  1. Added a data argument to ahist() to provide raw data for visualization.
  2. Allow x to ahist() to be an object of the class "Ckmeans.1d.dp" to avoid
     recomputing the clustering if it has already been done. This requires the
     data for clustering to be provided via the data argument.

  2016-10-11
  1. Added an argument add.sticks=TRUE to ahist() to turn on or off the sticks
  just above the horizontal axis.
  2. Added an argument style to ahist() for different styles of adaptive
  histogram.

Version 3.4.6-3
  Changes
  2016-10-03
  1. Updated examples in Ckmeans.1d.dp() manual

  Changes
  2016-10-01
  1. Added a new function plot() to visualize the clusters.

  2016-09-30
  1. Updated examples of ahist().
  2. Added sticks to ahist() to show the original input data.

  2016-09-27
  1. Fixed ahist() when there is only a single bin detected.
  2. Made ahist() run much faster than the previous version.
  3. Updated previous examples and added more examples to illustrate
     the use of ahist() better.

Version 3.4.6-2
  Changes
  2016-09-25
  1. Introduced a new function ahist() to generate adaptive histograms
     corresponding to the optimal univariate k-means clustering.

Version 3.4.6-1
  Changes
  2016-08-28
  1. Removed usage of lambda functions in C++ code for compatibility with
     older versions of C++ compilers.
  2. Shifted the values of x by median to improve numerical stability.

Version 3.4.6
  Changes
  2016-05-25
  1. Implemented an O(kn lg n) algorithm, speeding up the program greatly.

Version 3.4.5
  Changes
  2016-05-22
  1. s[j,i] is now computed in constant time now based on pre-computed
     sums of input x and its squares from 0 to i.

Version 3.4.4
  Changes
  2016-05-22
  1. Incorporated a numerically stable method for computing sample variance when
     selecting the number of clusters.
  2. Improved documentation.
  3. Removed a typo in describing time complexity.

  2016-05-18
  1. Now Ckmeans.1d.dp() function returns "totss", "tot.withinss", and
     "betweenss" statistics to summarize the optimal clustering obtained
  2. print.Ckmeans.1d.dp() print out the above statistics

Version 3.4.3
  Changes
  2016-05-15
  1. Upgraded to support c++11.
  2. Introduced optimal k-means clustering for weighted data.

Version 3.4.2
  Changes
  2016-05-14
  1. Implemented backward filling of the dynamic programming matrix to
     utlize lower bounds for the optimal cluster boundary. This step
     substantially reduced the runtime by half (two or more times faster).

  2016-05-07
  1. Implemented mathematically proven tighter ranges when searching for
     cluster boundaries. The runtime of the function is greatly reduced.
     Most notably, the runtime is roughly constant when number of clusters
     increases after k=2.
  2. Integrated all test cases into one single file.

Version 3.4.0
  Changes
  2016-05-07
  1. Substantial runtime reduction. Added code to check for an upper bound
     for the sum of within cluster square distances. This reduced the runtime
     by half when clustering 100000 points (from standard normal distribution)
     into 10 clusters.
  2. Eliminated the unnecessary calculation of (n-1) elements in the dynamic
     programming matrix that are not needed for the final result. This
     resulted in enormous reduction in run time when the number of cluster
     is 2: assigning one million points into two clusters took half a
     a second on iMac with 2.93 GHz Intel Core i7 processor.
  3. Included a reference to the first description of the dynamic programming
     solution by Richard Bellman (1973).

Version 3.3.3
  Changes
  2016-05-03
  1. Fixed a bug on cluster assignment when there is only one cluster. This
     was a bug introduced in version 3.3.2.

Version 3.3.2
  Changes
  2016-05-03
  1. Added automatic test cases.
  2. Removed an incorrect warning message when the number of clusters is equal
     to the number of unique elements in the input vector.
  3. Changed from 1-based to 0-based C implementation.
  4. Optimized the code by reducing overhead. See 22% reduction in runtime to
     repeatedly cluster seven points into two clusters one million times.

Version 3.3.1 2015-02-10
  Changes
  1. Fixed a problem that prevented Windows compilation (now forced the size_t
     type to unsigned long in max() function.

Version 3.3.0 2015-02-09
  Changes
  1. Added automated test cases into the package.
  2. Changed the code to not issue a warning message when the number of clusters
     is estimated to be 1.
  3. When lower bound of the number of clusters is greater than the unique
     number of elements in the input vector, both the min and max numbers of
     clusters are set to the number of unique number of input values.
  4. When the upper bound of the number of clusters is greater than the unique
     number of elements in the input vector, the max number of clusters is set
     to the number of unique elements in the input vector.
  5. Use warning() instead of cat() to display warning messages.
  6. Incorporate changes suggested by a user to speed up the code.
  7. Revised the examples and documentation to improve usability of the package
     in general.
  8. Started the NEWS file.

Version 3.02 2014-03-24 and earlier
  Changes
  1. The program now automatically determines the number of clusters from a
     given range.
  2. The program is optimized further speedup.
